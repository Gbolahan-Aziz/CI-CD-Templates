The following are recommendations to have in mind when using github action for your Continous Integration and Continous Deployment:
- ## Modularize Your Workflows:
        Break down your CI/CD process into smaller
        reusable actions to promote reusability and maintainability.

- ## Use Secrets for Sensitive Data:
        Store sensitive data like API keys or passwords in GitHub Secrets and reference them in your workflows to keep them secure.

- ## Optimize for Efficiency: 
        Use caching for dependencies to speed up your build times. 
        Also, be mindful of the resources your workflows consume.

- ## Branching Strategy: 
        Implement a robust branching strategy, like Git Flow, to manage your codebase effectively.

- ## Test Automation: 
        Integrate automated testing into your workflows to ensure code quality and reliability.

- ## Documentation: 
        Keep your workflow files well-documented for clarity and ease of maintenance.

- ## Monitor and Review Logs:
        Regularly review workflow logs for errors or inefficiencies and to understand how your pipelines are performing.
